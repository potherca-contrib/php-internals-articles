# PHP Internals Articles

This repository contains articles that will aim to provide an introduction into
[PHP's internals](https://github.com/php/php-src). Some articles will take a
pragmatic approach (typically having more breadth with less depth), and other
articles will focus solely on particular aspects of internals (typically having
less breadth with great depth). All of the articles here will be written for
PHP 7 (powered by the Zend Engine version 3 (ZE3)) and above.

These articles assume that the reader is able to build PHP from source. If this
is not the case, then please see the [Building PHP](http://www.phpinternalsbook.com/build_system/building_php.html) chapter of
the [PHP Internals Book](http://www.phpinternalsbook.com/) first.
